Security Recommendations:

- It is recommended to use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for the password (e.g., Arista@2024).
- The pop-up window will automatically close after saving; no manual refresh is required.

(Based on the latest Cloudflare UI optimization guidelines, key fields and password complexity requirements are emphasized.)
